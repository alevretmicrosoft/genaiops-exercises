    "- Set up and configure multiple Azure OpenAI model endpoints.\n",
    "- Load, preprocess, and prepare datasets for evaluation tasks.\n",
    "- Run automated evaluations and systematically compare model outputs.\n",
    "- Analyze results to identify which AI models perform best on specific tasks.\n",
